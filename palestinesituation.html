<h1>The Situation in Palestine</h1>

    <br>There are 74,925 injured Palestinians 
    <br>There are 2,000,000 displaced Palestinians
    <br>There are 11,270 detained Palestinians
    <br>There are 355,000 damaged housing units

    <br><br>The numbers signficantly increase every day. These figures only show the genocidal acts done by israel in Palestine since October 7th 2023, it has been going on for much longer. Those who don't add to the numbers, live in despair watching their loved ones suffer.
