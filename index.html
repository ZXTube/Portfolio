    <h3 id="intro-text">My name is Ziyad Edris. I started coding in 2019 and started by making
        small Unity games, then I tried everything, Python (Pygame), C++ (SFML), Assembly (x86), Ethical Hacking
        (Disassembling), MicroPython (Raspberry PI Pico), Chrome extensions (You Shield), SaaS Website (no frameworks)
        and more. Here are some of my favourite projects:

<pre style="height:15.5vw"><h1>YouShield</h1>
A chrome extension to end binge watching. 361 weekly active users as of Nov 9th 2024. 12 reviews, all 5 stars. <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youshield-remove-youtube/iohilpdcenclcjbjbebbjgpiimobkpje?hl=en-GB&authuser=1">Check it out.</a>
<!-- I made this chrome extension because I found myself wasting too much time watching useless things on youtube, so I made it hide the video recommendations in the homepage and on the right of the videos being watched and stop me from scrolling through youtube shorts, it allows only one short. -->

<!-- This is version two, I have version one on my github page, it had a menu where the user would choose how much time they want to have on youtube everyday, but I realized that there are useful tutorials or things that are not a waste of time, and I found it not very effective so I decided to make version two. -->

<!-- <h2>Challenges</h2> -->
<!-- I didn't have any previous experience with chrome extension or any kind of extension so I had to learn a lot of new things like the manifest.json. I also had to understand a lot more about HTML to be able to tell the extensions what elements to delete or modify. -->

<!-- But other than that it was more of just searching for the things to remove and finding a correct stable way to remove them. Like when I told the extension to remove the video recommendations on the right when a video is being watched it also deleted the all of the video when I opened the page of any channel and I realized that both elements had the same id -->

<!-- <h2>Technical Details</h2> -->
<!-- I used HTML, and JavaScript for this without any external libraries -->

<!-- <h2>Extra</h2> -->
<!-- I was planning to make another extension called InstaShield but I didn't see much installs of YouShield in the chrome web store and I didn't feel like it will be very useful, because it would have only worked if you used instagram on the browser, which I don't think very much people do, or waste time doing at least. -->

<pre style="height:15.5vw"><h1>KalemGPT</h1>
A chatbot website that uses ChatGPT 3.5 in the backend. I wanted to learn how to use the OpenAI api. Bought a domain for it for a year and multiple people used it from different contires. Stopped it because the api free trial ended.
<!-- This is a SaaS (Software as a Service) tool with the main purpose of allowing users mainly from Egypt to access ChatGPT, becuase making a ChatGPT account with an account that is known to have been made in Egypt doesn't work, so this tool is an alternative. -->

<!-- It is in the arabic language, which is the most popular language in Egypt. -->

<!-- It uses the OpenAI api and sends the users inputs to the api and recieves chatgpt-3.5 answers from it. -->

<!-- 47 anonymous conversations were made on this website. -->

<!-- <h2>Challenges</h2> -->
<!-- I didn't have any previous experience with using any api or with making a whole website so I spent a lot of time understanding and trying things and I didn't have any experience with domains, hosting and how hosting tools work so that also caused some more pain and suffering. -->

<!-- The most thing I suffered of was the backend, I didn't even know what the backend meant, (it's the server part of a website, I'll explain), I ended up using google's cloud functions, so the users click a button which sends what they wrote in the prompt to the cloud function, the function talks to the api and sends the answer to the client. This took me wayyyy too much time, maybe 2 weeks, most of the time just not understanding why the function is not working, the main reason it took me so long is because testing the code I wrote took 3 minutes, so if I wrote 1 letter wrong I would waste 6 minutes, and just forget everything I was doing or thinking about causing me to make more simple mistakes. -->

<!-- I knew that the free trial OpenAI gave me in the api was enough for atleast maybe 1000 questions and answers and if that runs out I would just use another account, and if that runs out I would just pay for the api it would be worth it at this point. But then ChatGPT decreased the freetrial to much less close to fourth and most the prompts the users input were in Arabic which turned out to be more expensive than English and the free tial turned out to also be just 3 months and I made my account before starting this project by like a 2 months so it ran out and the website started giving errors because the free trial ran out and I still haven't made a different account and told the website to use it yet, and I don't know if I will. -->

<!-- <h2>Technical Details</h2> -->
<!-- I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this and I used Google's Cloud Functions for the backend and Namecheap and Cpanel for hosting and domain -->

<!-- <h2>Extra</h2> -->
<!-- Brought me a step closer. -->

A SaaS tool to help web designers find local clients. Uses google maps in the backend.
<!-- This is my second SaaS (Software as a Service) tool made for web designers and web design agencies to help them find nearby clients with bad or no websites, in a certain radius from a chosen location on the map and a chosen category (coffee, gym, etc.). The website allows them to sort the found businesses by rating, number of ratings, an average between the ratings and number of ratings, if the bussiness has a website or not, website performance or website SEO (Search Engine Optimization (how likely it is to appear on a google search)). -->

<!-- I made a landing page for this tool with the aim of making facebook ads and making it send people to it. It makes people input their email to spin a wheel to win an offer when the tool is launched. I made this to be able to verify how useful and wanted this tool is, and if it's worth making. I haven't made the facebook ads yet. I have made 95% percent of this tool, I just need to make the facebook ads. -->

<!-- <h2>Challenges</h2> -->
<!-- I also used google's cloud functions in this project (suffered from it in my project KalemGPT). Because it is pretty cheap, I still suffered, but this time I was more efficient, I did learn from my mistakes and use firebase realtime database(To store collected emails and login ids) instead of google cloud realtime database and I used firebase authentication to allow users to make accounts. -->

Learning how to process what's on the screen to move the mouse and click targets. As quickly as possible.
<!-- I decided to make a bot to destroy this <a href="http://www.aimbooster.com">aimbooster website</a> because I wanted to learn how to automate mouse movement depending on what's on the screen and because it's cool -->

<!-- <h2>Challenges</h2> -->
<!-- I faced a lot of weird unexpected challenges though, one of them was that the bot would click 2 times on most targets (in the image with 50% accuracy), even if the game said that it's running on 60 fps and I set the bot to run on 30, it clicks on most targets two times, so it seems like the game checks for clicks at around 5 frames per second, but if I make the bot run on 5 fps it would be too slow, especially because I need 1 frame for every target to wait for it to dissapear because I don't want to click it multiple times and finding out what the diameter of the sphere is would be too slow because the diamater gets bigger then smaller over 3 seconds -->

<!-- So, I decided to find out the maximum size of any circle, around 70 pixels and whenever the bot clicks at any point it excludes a 140px by 140px square in the next frame with that point as it's center, the square is 140 by 140 because the bot doesn't know where in the circle it clicked, center, right, bottom, etc. (And the result is in the other image) (the accuracy was 100% but pressing the button to take the screenshot got identified as a click) -->

<!-- When I run the bot with 10 targets per second it seems to be doing good at the start but then random drop frames start happening and the fps gets worse as the bot fails to click more and more targets until targets get removed after being clicked by 1 second and all of my pain and suffering turn out to be useless. -->

<!-- <h2>Technical Details</h2> -->
<!-- I used python for this project and I used the libraries: win32api for clicking, win32con for mouse event values and pyautogui for taking screenshots -->
